**Hello! My name is Thomas!**

I have been working at the Center for Data Processing at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz since 2010.
In 2018, I was appointed head of software development there and, together with my team, I am responsible for various applications related to studying and university administration.
Since 2014, I have also been primarily responsible for operating the authentication and authorization infrastructure based on Microsoft ADFS, Shibboleth IdP, and several OpenId-Connect servers.
In 2022, we began making parts of our software available on GitHub as open source software.

In addition to my day job, I have been self-employed on a part-time basis since 2011, selling my expertise in the field of software development.
My experience has also given me the idea of making small products available as open source (but not necessarily free) software for private use.  
This is how [ACME-PS](/products/acme-ps/) and the [ACME-ADCS server](/products/acme-adcs-server/) came about.


## What can I offer?

I would describe myself as an expert in .net—especially in C#, ASP.net Core, Blazor, Razor, and Entity Framework, as well as PowerShell.  
I also have in-depth knowledge of WPF, WinForms, MAUI, Xamarin, HTML, (S)CSS, TypeScript, Angular, React, JavaScript, and SQL.
In addition, I have knowledge of operating IIS (as an application and proxy server), Apache WebServer, Nginx WebServer, MS SQL Server, AD FS (as a primary authentication server and federation gateway), Shibboleth (as a federation gateway), OpenId-Connect (as a protocol server based on [IdentityServer](https://github.com/Duende/) and [OpenIddict](https://github.com/OpenIddict)), and MS Azure.  
I have also gained experience with HUGO (this website), C++, Java, GO, YARP, Caddy, WordPress, Moodle, PHP, SharePoint, Jetty, Tomcat, and much more.  
In my day job, I am also responsible for the login and authentication infrastructure, which has recently been converted to FIDO2 passkeys.


## Was kann ich bieten?

Ich würde mich selbst als _Experte_ im Thema .net bezeichnen - insbesondere in C#, ASP.net Core, Blazor, Razor und Entity Framework sowie der PowerShell.  
Des Weiteren verfüge ich über tiefergehendes Wissen im Umgang mit WPF, WinForms, MAUI, Xamarin, HTML, (S)CSS, TypeScropt, Angular, React, JavaScript und SQL.
Dazu kommt Wissen im Betrieb von IIS (als Applikations- und Proxyserver), Apache WebServer, Nginx WebServer, MS SQL Server, AD FS (als primärer Authentisierungserver und Federation Gateway), Shibboleth (als Federation Gateway), OpenId-Connect (als Protokollserver auf Basis von [IdentityServer](https://github.com/Duende/) und [OpenIddict](https://github.com/OpenIddict)) sowie MS Azure.  
Erfahrung mit HUGO (diese Webseite), C++, Java, GO, YARP, Caddy, WordPress, Moodle, PHP, SharePoint, Jetty, Tomcat, uvm. konnte ich ebenfalls sammeln.  
Bei meinem "Day-Job" bin ich zudem verantwortlich für die Anmelde- und Authentifizierungsinfrastruktur, welche aktuell auf FIDO2 Passkeys umgestellt wurde.


## What about the name?

th||s [pronounced: *this* [thĭs]] is a stylization of th11s, intended to resemble the OR used in many programming languages.
th11s itself is a [numeronym](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for “Thomas Ottenhus” (the space was not counted).
