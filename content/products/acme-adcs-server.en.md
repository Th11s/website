# Manual certificates? Not anymore.
Certificates expire, get overlooked, or are issued incorrectly — and that's when it gets expensive. Manual processes take time, generate errors, and increase security risks.  
ACME ADCS Server fully automates issuance and renewal via the ACME protocol. It connects the Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Authority with the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (known from Let's Encrypt) and allows you to issue certificates from your Active Directory Certificate Authority with an ACME (RFC 8555) compatible client.  
This way, you maintain control and security at all times without any additional effort.

# Why ACME-ADCS Server is the right choice
- **Free trial**  
ACME ADCS can be fully tested before a decision is made. No risks, no obligations.
- **Open source code**  
The entire solution is transparent. Companies retain full control and can easily perform security checks, audits, or internal reviews.  
- **Seamless integration**  
ACME ADCS can be integrated directly into existing software  and infrastructure landscapes—ideal for companies with individual processes or compliance requirements.  
- **Customizable to your needs**   
Thanks to its open code, the solution can be expanded, integrated, or modified to fit your internal processes perfectly.  
- **Moderate licensing costs**   
At a one-time fee of €1,500 per corporate group, ACME ADCS offers excellent value for money, especially when compared to complex solutions. No extra costs per instance, user, server, certificate, or similar.
