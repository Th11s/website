This is a [PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ACME-PS/) that contains an RFC 8555 (ACME protocol) compatible client library.  
Based on ACME-PS, simple scripts can be written that enable TLS certificates to be obtained from Let's Encrypt or other compatible servers, for example.

Examples can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PKISharp/ACME-PS)..
